Mapshaper practice and example building through gameplay

The goal is to create a map using scripts and reproduceable methods for learning purposes, to show some of the capabilities and to spark ideas within the broader team. And to have a little fun along the way. 

A map is created without any legends or annotations and given only a category, others will have to try to guess what the question is.
